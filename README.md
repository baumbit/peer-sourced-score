# Peercuration

## TL;DR
Peercuration makes it possible to mitigate proliferation of spam in decentralized social media networks. It is a simple mechanism that works like this. A node in a network, query its trusted peer nodes for their individual score of a hash, and then calculate an average score. The hash is a mathematically derived identifier for a digitally encoded resource. The score is a value between 0 and 1. This mechanism provides the means of creating a sorted list of digital resources (such as images, videos, social media comments, etc.), which makes it possible to weed out bad content from good and thus produce a curated list.

## The problem
In the early 2020 it was impossible to ignore how many people had become aware of the power of "the algorithm". Elon Musk boosted the outcry against "the Twitter algorithm" on Twitter and argued that it should be open sourced. Other people made it clear that merely making code open source was not enough, and social networks needed to be decentralized, so as to put an end to centrally controlled content distribution. People argued that Facebook streams, YouTube video lists, where designed to captivate people by creating "hits of dopamine" and did not have the best of the users as heart. True or not, all content platform need some way to filter through all the content and decide which content should have the highest priority and which content should be deleted.

## Spam
While decentralization of social media solves some of the issues related to centrally controlled content distribution, it opens the doors further to other issues such as spam. In an open network, it is difficult to prevent bots from creating a never ending stream of spam. While heavily modereated social media platforms such as Reddit, may be critized for censoring comments, at least spam and content that do not belong in the stream, is weeded out by moderators. In an open network, this fix is incompatable with the ethos of decentralization.

## The Solution: Peercuration
We propose a solution to this problem which we call Peercuration. Inspired by concepts such as "Wisdom of crowds" and "Web of trust", the general idea behind Peercuration, is that you as a user knows the best which other users you want to trust and follow. Afterall, you probably do not want someone else to tell you what content you should prefer to consume or not.

When everyone in a network establish connections with those they trust the most, then together they create a web of trust. This trust can be leveraged to weed out spam and moderate content. The only thing needed is for everyone to create a score content they consume and this information is then used to create an average score. Content with the best score can be prioritized for download and display in user interfaces, and content with the lowest score might even be blocked from propagation.

## The curation mechanism
It is possible to mathematically derive a numerical representation (called a hash) of all digital resources such as images, comments, JSON objects, etc., which is smaller than the resource itself. A score between 0 and 1 can then be tied to this hash. It is a good idea to great a floor (zero) and a ceiling (one), because this way no node in the network can sque the average score in either direction. A hash and a score can easily be stored in a HashMap or similar, thus it is easy and fast to find out what score a hash has.

As a node on the network, you have your own oppinion on what the appropriate score of a specific content is. This is the score you should share with your peers, when they are asking you for your score. Sure you could lie and always send the lowest or the highest score no matter what the content is, but such bad behaviour will be punished when your peers finds out that your scoring tends to overlap poorly with their own preferences. Or more bluntly put; if you start sending spam to your peers are likely to stop asking you for content, block you and maybe even drop the conncetion they have with you. You are pushed out from the web of trust and now on your own. Hence good behaviour is rewarded and bad behavour punished.

Note, what is considered bad or good is fully subjective. If you peers do not like your scoring, you are probably better of if you find another group of peers that share your preferences.

And this is how digital resources gets sorted in the network. Different content will gravitate to different parts of the overall network and only that content which everyone agrees on is spam, will be dropped by everyone. Content that everyone feels is the most valuable, will be propagated the most and persist the longest in the network.

## Nostr and ZAPS
We believe it is possible to marry the concept of ZAPs and Peercuration, by integrating the relative value of a ZAP into the calculation of the score.

### What is a ZAP?
When you send BTC to a signer of a note in Nostr, this is called a ZAP. It is a great way of rewarding good content and intuitevly it should also be leveratge to weed out bad content (no reward) from good content (signer ZAPed lots of BTC). However, there is a catch! Since value is subjective, someone that loves cat might ZAP 1 BTC to a cat post, and people that love dog might ZAP 2 BTC to a post about dogs. The problem of using amount of ZAPs a post is rewarded with, is that the cat lover will now see only the dog posts because they were rewarded more ZAPs. And perhaps even worse, they dog lover might have created a sockpuppet account so the dog lover can send ZAPs to himself to boost the dog posts in the sorting algorithm without actually loosing any BTC. The good news is, we believe there is a solution to both of these problems!

### How to integrate ZAP into Peercuration.
The fundamental idea of peercuration, is that a user will rely on its web of trust for sifting through content and sort out the good from the bad. The user could even be running several different instances of the Peercuration mechanism and have a Peercuration group dedicated to cats and another dedicated to dogs. This way different types of content can compete with the content type if belongs to which is what we want. However even if the Peercuration score is created by drawing on the average score of the Peergroup, a wealthy user will be able to ZAP tremendous amounts compared to other peers in the group! To solve this issue, the ZAPs are not integrated at face value, instead the score gets calculated by comparing each individual peer with its history. Thus all peers in a Peercuration group have equal weighting to one another, not matter their particualt economic circumstance.

Example:
Alice has in total 0.01 BTC, usually ZAP 0.00001 BTC and then ZAPs her entire net worth of 0.01 BTC, because she really loved the note.
Bob has 200 BTC, usually ZAP 10 BTC and then ZAPs 0.2 BTC, because he thought the post had ok quality.
Obviously Alice Peercuration score should be much, much higher then Bobs, because she spent all she had.
By measuring what they usually ZAP, we can normalize their own individual ZAP levels and thus calculate a value between 0 and 1 which measure how much they wanted to reward a specific post compared to how much they usually rewards posts.

If someone have no BTC at all, this is not a problem. Since the users usually do not ZAP the Peercuration score will not be negatively affected by the user not ZAPing, because the user never does.

Likes, reposts, ZAPs can then be averaged together to create the Peercuration score between 0 and 1. Now all the scores in the Peercuration group can be combined and create an average score.
